# JourneyHawk
JourneyHawk is a safety app that functions as a way to keep track and monitor where attendees are during a field-trip day. The app can be used by either teachers, professors, parents, and chaperones attending the trip, which includes several different features within the app to ensure that every attendee is safe under adult supervision.
